# Hacknet-For-CMD-VB.NET-Edition
Hello! I'm Null.<br/>
This is my first VB.NET project.<br/>
Libraries uses CSharp.<br/>
And I'm trying to make a Game engine for Windows Command Prompt uses these CS Libs.<br/>
I'm joined Hacknet for cmd official discord server, and I remaked this game uses Java.<br/>
But my Java version has been surpassed.<br/>
Now, I'm sugguest you to play [C++ Edition](https://github.com/Skiawm91/HacknetCMD-Core) by [@Skiawm91](https://github.com/Skiawm91)
Or wait for VB.NET Edition.
